# Pact Matching FFI

This crate provides a Foreign Function Interface (FFI) to the `pact_matching` crate,
with the intent of enabling Pact's core matching mechanisms to be used by implementations
in other languages.

## Building

For convenience, this tool integrates with CMake, which is setup to:

1. Run Cargo to build the library file.
2. Run Cbindgen to build the header file.
3. Run Doxygen to build the documentation.

To use this CMake build, you can do the following:

```bash
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ cmake --build .
```

You can also optionally install the built artifacts as follows:

```bash
$ cmake --install . --prefix=<install location (omit to install globally)>
```

## Examples

This project also includes example uses which depend on the crate via CMake.

Before building an example, make sure to run the following from the overall CMake build
directory (`./build`):

```bash
$ cmake --install . --prefix ./install
```

Then, from the example's directory, do the following:

```bash
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ cmake --build .
```
